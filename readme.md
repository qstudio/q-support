## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Do I need to create an account in order to use this plugin ###

In order for the WordPress Support plugin to submit questions to the WP Support website, it's required to "connect" your current WordPress user ( the one you are logged into you own WordPress installation as ) to the WP Support website.

This process invovles creating a new user account on WP Support - if you already have a WP Support user account and are using the same email - you will be "re-connected" to this account.

If you choose not to "connect" you account - the plugin cannot send or recieve information from WP Support - which renders it practically useless - however, you could still post and follow up questions directly on the WP Support website, if you prefer.
